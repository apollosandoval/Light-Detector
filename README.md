# Light-Detector
Light metering system for deciding optimal growth locations in an urban environment.

-BOM
  Includes 'Bill of materials' currently just a brain storming session of what fundamentals components might be needed   for prototyping.

-IdeaZone
  Brainstorming area. Add features, functionality, give it psychadelic colors, talk about what it could eventually grow to become. This is a place for inspired thought.
  
-Drawings
  Sketches mostly, fun Industrial Design stuff, paper circuits and calculations.
  
-CAD
  Probably going to be using Onshape to prevent any problems with CAD licenses.
  
-Software
  Probably pretty basic for now, writing to memory and figuring out a good download scheme. Perhaps a GUI. Going to be using Python, or arduino for prototyping.
  
-Business Plan
  Mostly for fun, this is a good place to think and write about a 'customer base,' figure out what makes sense for a 'product.' This material will mostly likely culminate in an effective Kickstarter video and not much beyond that.
